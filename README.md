This repository is dedicated to analysing the dataset based on accidents that occured in USA to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather and time of day.
This is for a task 4 of SkillCraft summer internship. I have successfully performed various operations to plot various charts that help to visualise all the necessary components of this data.
KEY CONCEPTS USED => data visualisation, sorting missing data, scatterplots and barplots, pie charts and understanding of tabular axes.
